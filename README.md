COMMON QUESTIONS
----------------

Q. Is TamaniChess Open Source?  
A. TamaniChess's License is a modified version of the standard BSD license. The primary modification is that we do not allow commercial distribution or use of TamaniChess, in order to limit some of the obvious abuses of the code and construction plans. Because of this modification, TamaniChess's license does not fall under the definition of an Open Source (uppercase) license.
Confusingly, TamaniChess is often referred to as open source (lowercase), as its development shares much in common with other open source projects. However, in spite of its freely available source code, TamaniChess may not be used in a commercial setting, as specified by its license.

Q. Can I include TamaniChess with my product?  
A. No. TamaniChess is not licensed for commercial use. Using TamaniChess as a "freebie" or including it at "no cost" with your product still constitutes commerical usage and is forbidden by the license.

Q. Can I sell my product with the TamaniChess logo on it?  
A. No. Putting the logo on your product makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed by Sebastian Loncar, and constitutes trademark infringement.

Q. Can I use the TamaniChess logo to advertise my product?  
A. No. Using the logo in your advertising makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed by Sebastian Loncar, and constitutes trademark infringement.

Q. Can I use the term "TamaniChess" in the name of my software?  
A. Generally, no, especially if it is something that is sold. However, if you are producing a free TamaniChess-related piece of software, it is common that permission is granted. Send a query to double- check first, please.

Q. Can I put an arcade cabinet running TamaniChess in a public location?  
A. No. This this a commercial use of TamaniChess and is prohibited by the license. Even if you don't charge money, putting a machine in a public location is "operating" an arcade machine and falls under commercial rules in most locations.

Q. Can my non-profit use TamaniChess or an arcade cabinet running TamaniChess to help raise money?  
A. No, sorry. Even for the most worthwhile cause, this still is a commercial use of TamaniChess and is prohibited by the license.

Q. How do I obtain a license to the TamaniChess source code?  
A. You can't. See the Copyright section above.
